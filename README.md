## 🛠️ Features

The project contains the following examples:

1. **Basic Output (`hello`)**  
   Demonstration of simple text output using `print`.

2. **Arithmetic (`math`)**  
   Example of basic arithmetic operations with functions.

3. **Conditions (`condition`)**  
   Use of `if-else` to check variable values.

4. **Loops (`counter`, `whileloop`, `forloop`)**  
   - Infinite loop with `break`.
   - `while` loop for conditional iteration.
   - `for` loop for iterating over a range.

5. **Structures (`structure`, `rectanglee`)**  
   - Definition and usage of custom data structures (`struct`).
   - Implementation of methods for structs.

6. **Ownership (`ownership`)**  
   Demonstration of Rust's ownership model with strings.

7. **Error Handling (`error`)**  
   Example of handling file operations with `match` and error handling.

8. **Vectors (`vector`)**  
   Introduction to dynamic arrays in Rust (`Vec<T>`).

9. **Hash Maps (`hashmap`)**  
   Demonstration of key-value storage using `HashMap`.

10. **Modules (`modules`)**  
    Shows how to organize code into modules and use them in your program.
